			<h2>Freely, Publicly Available</h2>
			<p class="date">2015-03-10</p>
			<h3>The flood of Open Data offers great opportunities for innovation</h3>
<p>But let's not mistake data availability for wisdom.

<h2>Current Efforts at Open Data</h2>
<p>Admirably local, state, and the Federal government are making attempts at releasing massive amounts of data to the public. Living and working in the Washington Metropolitan area 've been lucky to be exposed to the leading edge of open data. For example, <a href="https://data.baltimorecity.gov/">I am very proud of the efforts made by Baltimore City to open their data catalog to citizens.</a> The city is dedicated to making information about homeless shelters, properties, city markets, crime and a slew of other metrics widely available. On the state level we have <a href="http://www.statestat.maryland.gov/">StateStat</a> and the <a href="https://data.maryland.gov/">open Maryland data portal.</a> And on the Federal level various agencies have been attempting to open their data to the public (per the image above) with Data.Gov leading the charge.</p>

<p><br>
Private companies are also releasing data to the public, but understandably on a much more limited basis. <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limiting">Twitter has limited the number of requests that can be pulled from their API</a> while <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/bensmith/uber-executive-suggests-digging-up-dirt-on-journalists#.tdem9rNXx">other companies, like Uber, have stumbled in their stewardship.</a> </p>
<h2>Open Data's Potential</h2>
<p>This abundant open data coupled with increased processing power are birthing new innovative efforts by citizens and organizations. For example, here in the D.C. area we have organizations such as <a href="http://www.codefordc.org"><strong>Code for DC</strong></a> using open data to achieve public goals; one project in particular is helping <a href="http://codefordc.github.io/districthousing/">accelerate the affordable housing application process.</a> Whole organizations have been initiated and augmented with this open data. District Data Labs has sprung up to help parse data while organizations such as the Sunlight Foundation use it to further their efforts. Journalists at Vox.com and Governing are using it to investigate topics like <a href="http://www.governing.com/topics/urban/gov-washington-affordable-housing-protections-gentrification-series.html">gentrification in the D.C. area.</a></p>
<p>In addition to these efforts Open Data can help revolutionize research fields. As an example, imagine an open repository site for all research papers that are accepted after peer review (a Github for academics, if you will). Non-sensitive data and the author's code could be posted so students and the public could review and replicate studies. We might be able to catch falsified reports earlier and halt their negative repercussions (e.g. falsified data linking autism to vaccinations). Other research projects could be crowdsourced and studies that take years to conduct could be bolstered by the labor of the enthused, just as projects are bolstered by contributors on Github.</p>
<h2>Power to the powerful, resistance from the entrenched</h2>
<p><em>The government is very keen on amassing statistics. They collect them, add them, raise them to the n-th power, take the cube root and prepare wonderful diagrams. But you must never forget that every one of these figures comes in the first instance from the village watchman, who just puts down what he damn pleases.</em>
--Comment of an English judge on the subject of Indian statistics; Quoted in Sir Josiah Stamp in "Some Economic Matters in Modern Life"</p>
<p>Even with increasing availability there are drawbacks and resistance to making everything open.</p>
<p>First, the rise of open data chiefly benefits those who can (1) access and process the data; (2) have the capacity to act on it. At the very least a person needs to be able to read a CSV file into a program like Excel, know how to transform it to become analysis ready and then (usually) perform a statistical analysis on it. Even for trained professionals it's sometimes hard to know where to begin, so what hope does the amateur data scientist have in understanding how to interpret the endless streams of data in front of them. It's easy to give up.</p>
<h3>This wealth of information offers power to those with the skill and capacity to interpret and act on it.</h3>
<p>And secondly, the cynical part of me wonders what kind of academics would make their data and statistical analyses open for public consumption. An easy way for a critic to discredit your research project is to discredit your methods. And using a non-standard model or making an error within your code would be an easy way to destroy a study's findings. Researchers would be taking a large risk by putting themselves in these spotlights.</p>
<p>It's also difficult to know where to draw the line on what the public should know. For example, should the public have open and free reign over video streams from police dashboard and personal cameras? Do we have the right to see the uncensored images coming in from military operations? There are other examples and they demand individual consideration.</p>
<h2>Nonetheless Open Data offers innovation, accountability, and strengthening trust in our systems.</h2>
<p>It is the way forward, and I embrace it.</p>
