			<h2>Expanding the sharing and service economies</h2>
			<p class="date">2015-03-03</p>
			<p>I regularly listen to Dan Benjamin on the 5by5.tv network and for each show he'll sell the audience on a couple of sponsorships. Usually I tune out while he reads them off but one of his newest sponsors had me listening attentively. The sponsor was the <a href="https://www.fivefourclothing.com/new/">Five Four Club</a> a service for men who don't like to shop for clothes. I don't need this service but if I had enough spare capital lying around I might participate in it. It wasn't the product exactly that I was interested in, what struck me was the fact that a legitimate company could be formed around sending men clothes each month in the mail.</p>
<p>For a person who has only ever bought clothes from a physical store after spending an annoying amount of time going, parking, trying on, reselving, talking to sales people, deciding on color, deciding on price, etc. For a person so used to that traditional model to realize that a company can be formed around sending clothes <strong>each month</strong> to men who have never tried these items on served as a realization. Specifically that </p>
<h2>all traditional service models can be reshaped by these contemporary forces.</h2>
<p>In a very real way. </p>
<p>Dan also regularly recommends other monthly services that
deliver straight to your home so you don't have to go to crowded stores
and wade through the plethora of substandard projects -- examples of
these delivery services range from <a href="https://www.harrys.com/">razors from Harrys</a> to
<a href="https://casper.com/">mattresses from Casper</a>. And there are abundant other examples: <a href="https://www.freshdirect.com/welcome.jsp">in certain cities there are food delivery
services</a>. In almost all cities across the United States there are ride
sharing services, think <a href="http://www.zipcar.com/">ZipCar</a> or <a href="https://www.car2go.com/en/austin/">Car2Go</a>. But why not just <a href="https://www.uber.com/">Uber</a> it or even bike around using a bike sharing service. You can book a room easily with <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">Airbnb</a> and find a date from a range of apps.</p>
<p>There has been a lot written about these changing trends. But it wasn't
until I heard Dan read about a service that will send men new clothes
each month to wear that I was shocked by the reality of it. All
traditional services that can be remade <strong>will</strong> be remade.  </p>
