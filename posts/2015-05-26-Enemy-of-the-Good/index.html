			<h2>Enemy of the Good</h2>
			<p class="date">2015-05-26</p>
			<p>The other day I felt lethargic and  watched a John Sonmez video. John is great about
dispensing advice, he's written a book about the kinds of soft skills
programmers should cultivate--these include maintaining a healthy
lifestyle, networking effectively, and setting and completing reasonable
side projects. After watching this video I realized I had placed myself
in a nasty feedback loop of setting unreasonable goals, not completing
them, setting other unreasonable goals and then becoming anxious I
wasn't completing those either.</p>
<p><strong>After watching his video I realized I
needed to say 'no' to some things and I needed a reboot.</strong></p>
<p>Two weeks prior to watching John's video I traveled to upstate NY for a
wedding and listened to most of Tim Ferris' <strong>The Four Hour Work
Week</strong> on the way. There's a lot to the book that I can't cover
in a parapgrah but I was most impressed by Tim's dedication to
achieving milestones. The book focuses on achievng the goals that will
led to a more effective life and removing distractions (even good
distractions like listening to the news or reading non-fiction books!)
is critical in achieving the things you want out of life.</p>
<p>I recommend these two resources and am myself looking to get back to
achieving. When you feel overwhelmed, have the power to say 'no' and
keep moving towards your goals.</p>
